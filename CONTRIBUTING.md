# Programming Standards

This document outlines basic programming standards for this project.

## _Standards_

1. _Anything_ gets done.... **PUSH IT**
    - If we finish anything, no matter how small. Just push it and merge with dev<br><br>
2. Use Variables
    - For long get calls, operations from other functions, or anything really... even if it seems obvious
    _create a variable_... its a simple thing but can make your code much _much_ more readable. (Especially if we
    use that variable more than once)<br><br>
3. UI message displaying (or other message displaying?)
    - Only have _ONE_ display call. Set a string called 'message' or something and pass it to the display function.<br><br>
4. **NO** huge blocks of code.
    - Space things out... we have room.
    - As a general rule, break blocks of code up into steps. For example;
    ```
    This block;
    Does one step;

    This block;
    Does another;
    ```
    If this is still unclear, feel free to message another group member for clarification.

## _Variable/Function Naming_
1. Function naming - _camelCase_
